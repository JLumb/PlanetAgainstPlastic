            <h2>How you can help</h2>

            <p> Here are a few very simple things you can do to help us save the planet;<br>
            <br> <i class="fas fa-recycle"></i> Recycling is one of the easiest and most effective ways of fighting plastic pollution.<br>
            This can be done by simply keeping an extra containers for specific items such as glass and plastic.<br>
            Keeping these seperate and disposing of them in the correct bins massively helps the recycling process and the impact on land fills.<br>
            <br>
            <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Community events are a more active and social way to combat plastic pollution.<br>
            There will be organzations in your local area that you can join, otherwise starting your own and posting on social media<br> 
            to advertise and grow is a fantastic idea. The idea of these organzations is to create and lead events where people can meet and clean<br>
            public areas such as beaches, woods and parks.<br>
            <br>
            <i class="fas fa-random"></i> Metal or wooden alternatives are also a great way to reduce waste.<br>
            Items that are easily substituted by these materials are straws, cutlery, water bottles. 
           
            <br>
