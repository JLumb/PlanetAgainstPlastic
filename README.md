#  User Experience (UX)

* Design
    * The colour scheme of this website is very simple but has its meaning, the colors i have chosen are recognized to represent wildlife globally.

    * The font style I have chosen to run throughout the webpage is 'koisei tokumin' as i find it very easy to read while still being appealing for users.

    * The image I have used throughout this website is meant to be shocking to appeal to the users sympathetic side and really get them to realise the change that is needed to be made. It also grabs the user attention and makes them more likely to return to and remember the website.


    * While designing this website I used balsamiq wireframe's to help me build the idea of what i wanted the end design to look like here are some examples of the wireframes i created.
